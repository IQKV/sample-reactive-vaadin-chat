git clone https://github.com/IQKV/sample-reactive-vaadin-chat.git
cd sample-reactive-vaadin-chat
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

You might also want to use Maven's `spring-boot:run` goal - applications run in an exploded form, as they do in your IDE:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local -P production
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IQKV/sample-reactive-vaadin-chat.git
